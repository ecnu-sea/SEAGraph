    "split_review":"I am organizing the format of review content. I will provide the review content for the '{section_name}' section between <REVIEW> and </REVIEW>. Please help standardize the output format with the following requirements:\n  1. Each comment should start with a “-” and any numbering (e.g., numbers, sequences) should be removed.\n  2. Comments should be separated by newline characters (\\n).\n  3. The output content must match the original comments exactly, without adding, modifying, or omitting anything.\n  4. Do not take titles as review comments.\n  5. Pay attention to the original comments’ line breaks and separators, as they are crucial for this task.",
    "augment_review": "I am reviewing peer feedback for a research paper. Based on the provided paper abstract and peer review comments, please enhance on the feedback. If the feedback is not clear enough, elaborate on it using the content of the abstract, and speculate on potential issues. For example, for comments like “poor writing,” analyze possible reasons (such as unclear abstract statements, weak logic, or difficulty understanding the methodology in specific sections of the paper). \nInput abstracts between <ABSTRACT> and </ABSTRACT>, and reviews between <REVIEW> and </REVIEW>. For the output format, you don’t need to include any extra statements like “Here is the output format based on the provided abstract and review comments.” Please do not split the output into points, just give me enhanced output of the entire review comments, with no more than 100 words of enhancement.",
    "themes_infer": "You are a researcher tasked with analyzing academic papers. I need your help to identify and organize domain themes for a target paper using its \"Related Work\" section and the abstracts of papers it cites. Here's what you need to do:\n    1. Identify Themes: Summarize a few domain-specific themes (up to five) based on the content of the \"Related Work\" section of the target paper and the abstracts of its cited papers.\n    2. Categorize Papers: Classify the cited papers under the identified themes. Note that a single paper may fall under multiple themes.\nFor example, if the target paper references n cited papers and you identify m themes, categorize the n papers by assigning them to one or more of the m themes. Exclude the target paper itself from categorization.",
    "rag_seagraph": "You are an experienced researcher with strong logical thinking and excellent reasoning skills. You will receive a paper along with a corresponding review comment. We have provided the key sections of the paper and the critical content from related work. The review comment is found between <REVIEW> and </REVIEW>, the key sections of the paper are between <PAPER HIGHLIGHTS> and </PAPER HIGHLIGHTS>, and the related work is found between <RELATED WORK> and </RELATED WORK>. Your task is to systematically find supporting evidence and construct a complete logical chain, thereby building a full reasoning chain to clarify why the reviewer made this comment. Please structure the reasoning chain as follows:\n- **Comment**: <specific comment>\n- **Evidence 1 (specific section) **: <corresponding reasoning>\n - **Evidence 2 (specific section)**: <corresponding reasoning>\n - ... (more evidence if available)\n- **Summary**: <Logical reasoning based on evidence explaining the basis for the review comment."
